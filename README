<Describe your project's features here>
The GUI contains a grid of buttons, a scoreboard, a clock and a list of all words that have been found.
It operates like a standard Boggle game - once a valid word is selected, letter by letter, and submitted,
it joins the list of words.
A unique feature we have added is that buttons that are not "neighbors" of the last selected button are disabled,
thus making the player only select a path valid according to the rules.
